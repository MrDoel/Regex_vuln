Hard-Coded Creds

(api_key|apikey|password|secret|private_key|access_token|auth_token|credentials|passwd|passphrase)['"]?\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"\s]+['"]

Input Validation (Potential XSS): Look for instances where user input might be directly inserted into the DOM.

\{\{.*\}\}
ng-bind-html=['"]?[^'^"]+['"]?
\$scope\.|\$element\.
\.innerHTML\s*=
\<form[^\>]*\>(?:(?!ng-submit|formGroup).)*\</form\>
This regex matches AngularJS expressions which might include user inputs. However, it's a broad match and may result in many false positives.

Unsafe AngularJS $sce Usage:
\$sce\.trustAsHtml|trustAsResourceUrl|trustAsJs|trustAsUrl

Insecure Direct Object References: Look for patterns where resources are directly referenced.
\/api\/.*\/[0-9]+
This regex aims to find direct object references in API URLs, such as numeric IDs. It's very simplistic and needs to be tailored to your API URL structure.

Improper Error Handling: Find instances of console logging or alerting error messages.
console\.log|alert
This regex looks for console.log or alert statements, which might be used for error logging.

Insecure File Uploads: Look for file upload fields without explicit validation checks.
\<input.*type=['"]?file['"]?.*\>
